                        <p>I began my college career as a varsity swimmer at the University of Pittsburgh.
                            After realizing that my passions lied elsewhere during my freshman year, I decided to
                            step away from the team to put all of my attention into my studies. Through many ups
                            and downs I have finally found my passion again in software. Although I found myself slightly
                            behind the curve in the competitve software industry, my passion and drive to succeed
                            has allowed me to make exciting progess in the past year. I completed my first
                            internship, competed in my first hackathon (and we won our track!), and involved myself in many different
                            projects and clubs on campus. In my free time I enjoy working out, listening to music, and further developing my
                            technical skills. I am excited to continue to grow as a professional!

                            Emberlite is a web app developed by my team during the Pitt Challenge 2023, a medical themed hackathon. Our
                            web app aims to improve mental health in medical professions and combat burnout in medical workers.
                            We utilize a Python backend tied to a MySQL server in order to recieve real time inputs from the app, and to store and visualize data.
                            Our front end is composed of CSS/HTML, and our web app was locally hosted. The project was completed in a 42 hour timeframe, and we
                            recieved first place for our track "Burnout in Healthcare Workers".

                            Micromouse is a national competition for STEM students to create an autonomous robot capable of traversing a maze. As a member of the navigation
                            and movement teams at Pitt, my responsibilities include creating C++ based navigation algorithms for traversing and solving the maze, and creating
                            PID control systems for our robot using inputs from infrared and sonar sensors. Our team plans to compete in the regional competition in Pittsburgh
                            in Spring 2024.

                            This project is based in fundemental software design. As a group of 7, my teammates and I are tasked with designing and implementing a realistic
                            simulation software of our local train system, with our professor acting as the client. We are taught to employ agile design methods, such as weekly
                            scrum meetings, vast documentation, customer collaboration, and weekly task delegation. This project is meant to prepare students to develop software
                            as a team, and throughout the semester I will gain invaluable skills that will translate well into industry.
